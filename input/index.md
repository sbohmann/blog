# A Modern Interpretation of OOP

Objects are about behavior.

## Overview
* OOP is about objects
* Objects are named in a terrifyingly misleading way.
* Objects are about behavior.
* Objects do not model real-world objects or concepts.
* Data structures like structs, POJOs / POCOs, or named tuples are not objects.
* Abstract data structures like lists, hash maps, persistent vectors, observables, or other monads have behavior but are semantically still not considered objects
